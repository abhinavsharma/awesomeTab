Predictive Newtab for Firefox
======================

The Idea
--------

Firefox does not currently implement a "speed-dial" to help you get to popular websites quickly. This add-on takes the idea of a "speed-dial" and extends it. It looks at the tabs you are currently browsing, and makes recommendations based on what you are currently viewing when you open a new tab. This is not meant to replace a speed-dial but instead supplement it. Also, it acts as a potential front end for developing a better search engine for Firefox history and other components.

Features
--------

Some useful feature that one might consider displaying on such a new tab page are:

+ Bookmarks similar to what pages are currently open.
+ Tagged bookmarks are gievn heavy preference
+ This is followed by a relevance score based on number of keywords matched
+ This is followed by frecency based ranking.
