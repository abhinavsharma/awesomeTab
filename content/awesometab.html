  <p>About</p>

  <p>The Predictive Newtab add-on is designed to help point you towards websites that may of of interest to you based on what you are currently browsing. These decisions are made entirely in your browser based on history and no personal data is sent to the web.</p>

  <p>We learn your tab switching behavior over time as you start using the addon so you should wait for a while (about a week of regular browsing) before its behavior stabilizes.</p>
  
  <p>Predictions come from one of four sources - your bookmarks, tabs you frequently switch between, links you follow from one site to another, and a text-based search through your Firefox history for similar results. This addon is a work in progress and likely to have bugs.</p>
